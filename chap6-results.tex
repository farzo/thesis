\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach}
simulation of the tool from 31-10-2014 
In order to evaluate the performance of the current tool, two approaches were taken:
\begin{itemize}
\item What vulnerabilities did CERN look into during this time? How fast my tool would find these vulnerabilities?
\item What vulnerabilities were found by my tool and could be important but was missed at CERN? (benefit of using my tool)
\end{itemize}
