\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach}
simulation of the tool from 31-10-2014 
In order to evaluate the performance of the current tool, two approaches were taken:
\begin{itemize}
\item What vulnerabilities did CERN look into during this time? How fast my tool would find these vulnerabilities?
\item What vulnerabilities were found by my tool and could be important but was missed at CERN? (benefit of using my tool)

\subsection{sending emails}
limiting the number of emails. how to decide? looking over the past two/three month
number of vulns / affected/ critical, etc.

there are many changes in the vulns. I loooked at the kind of changes 

among the changed vulnerabilities from 01.11.2014 to 07.01.2015
\begin{lstlisting}
cat *.txt | cut '-d;' -f1,5,6,8,9 | grep  '^c'|grep -f /afs/cern.ch/user/s/slopiens/public/wad_names_at_cern.txt | grep ';\([6-9]\|10\)\.'  | cut '-d;' -f5  | sed -e "s#\(.*\)\$\$\$\(.*\)#\1\n\2#" | cut -d "%" -f 1| sort | uniq -c
cat *.txt | cut '-d;' -f1,5,6,8 | grep  '^c'|grep -f /afs/cern.ch/user/s/slopiens/public/wad_names_at_cern.txt | grep ';\([6-9]\|10\)\.'  | cut -d ';' -f 2 | sort > vulns-cern-critical-changed.txt
cat *.txt | cut -d ';' -f1,5,9 | grep '^c'|grep -f vulns-cern-critical-changed.txt.ignore | cut -d ';' -f3 |sed -e "s#\(.*\)\$\$\$\(.*\)#\1\n\2#"| cut -d '%' -f 1 | sort | uniq -c
 38 all
 48 cvss_score
 2 description
 304 products
----------------------------------what kind of changes
field%old-value
38 all%unknown
48 cvss_score%None
48 products%
\end{lstlisting}

and decided to ignore version changes in cpe(s) and came up with these new numbers

decsion: send an email to SEC for each vulnerability. either new or changed


if this does not work

vulnerability openstack (CVE-2014-9493) can be an example.
\end{itemize}
