\section{Motivation}

\paragraph{}

Security Team performs scans of various types of resources, such as devices, web servers, web sites. As already discussed in chapter \ref{introduction}, it is impossible to scan these resources manually and there is a need for an Scanning Engine that would facilitate scheduling and running these scans (in both synchronous and asynchronous modes), sharing the load across multiple scanning hosts in a fault-tolerant way, and combining results.
WASDOM as discussed in section \ref{sec:tools} contains various scripts for detecting misconfigurations, e.g. expired certificates, basic HTTP authentication; or for detecting vulnerabilities, such as Heartbleed\footnote{Critical OpenSSL security bug disclosed in 2014}. The scanner as we are going to describe in this chapter is a wrapper around all these short scripts and it aims to facilitate scheduling and running these scripts (scans) by
\begin{enumerate}
\item Enabling the permanent and automatic scanning of resources, i.e. devices, websites, web servers, etc.
\item Making it possible to activate a subset of available detection scripts on targets
\item Showing a list of available detection scripts with an explanation of what kind of detection each does
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Use Cases}
\begin{itemize}
\item manual execution
\item automatic execution
\end{itemize}
