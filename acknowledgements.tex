I would like to use this opportunity to express my special appreciation and thanks to Mr. Sebastian Lopienski for his aspiring guidance and illuminating views on a number of issues related to the project. I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Philippe Janson for his invaluable advice on the progress of the project and the quality of this thesis, and Dr. Stefan Lueders for his continuous support and help with writing this thesis. In addition, a big thank you to my family and friends for their motivating words and their endless love. I would like to dedicate my work to my sister, Atefeh, without whose love and support, it would have been impossible for me to pursue a master degree at EPFL.
