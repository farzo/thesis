possible improvements:

in mapping algorithm use string distances

looking at versions when finding resources


+++++
If there is new resource detected at CERN: we can check in our archive and see if the new resource is affected by old vulnerabilities -> less likely. but atleast check for the recent vulnerbailities. A part of the firewall opening? 
another scope. not responding to new vulnerabilities but making sure a new resource is not vulnerable
\\
when finding matches (resources) care about the version as well
