This project introduced two new tools for detection of vulnerable web applications. The approachese used in these tools are different from common web scanners, such as skipfish. In this project we focused more on detecting vulnerable applications as soon as possible by monitoring publicly available vulnerability information and developing short detection scripts. 




possible improvements:

in mapping algorithm use string distances

looking at versions when finding resources

vnt extensions like forgetting,etc. 

scanner??


+++++
If there is new resource detected at CERN: we can check in our archive and see if the new resource is affected by old vulnerabilities -> less likely. but atleast check for the recent vulnerbailities. A part of the firewall opening? 
another scope. not responding to new vulnerabilities but making sure a new resource is not vulnerable
\\
when finding matches (resources) care about the version as well
