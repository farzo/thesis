\begin{itemize}
\item Big number of websites and web servers
\item increasing number of vulnerabilities
\item importance of detecting vulnerable applications
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions}
if there are some literature to explain. what is a vulnerability for example?

What is a vulnerability? Terminology? (useful for the thesis)

\section{CERN Web Landscape}
Web applications are getting much more popular . they are easy to develop but not so easy to to develop securely
vulnerable web app can make the server, database, internal network, data etc. insecure
they are publicly available
easy target for attackers

\subsection{Web Application Stack}
vulnerability can occur in each of the layers
\begin{itemize}
\item web server misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (like certificate related, weak ciphers, heartbleed) 
\item web application vulnerabilities
\item unpatched or outdated web applications
\end{itemize}


software that is used in each layer
\begin{itemize}
\item developed internally
\item used out of the box
\end{itemize}
examples of each
if out of the box the vulnerabilities are usually discovered and reported in the public.
internally developed ones need to be checked before open to outside

\subsection{CERN Websites}
There are two types of websites and web servers used at CERN.
\subsubsection{centrally hosted websites}
These websites are hosted centrally by the IT department. Currently there are about 13k instances of these websites. Each of them has a URL in the format of \texttt{\url{http://cern.ch/X}} or \texttt{\ur{http://X.web.cern.ch}}, where X is the name of the website. Examples like \url{http://home.web.cern.ch/}. Managed by WebServices \url{http://cern.ch/web} and could have various types 
(file/application hosting:)
–

IIS (Windows), files on DFS
-
> PHP, ASP
–
Apache (Linux), files on AFS
-
> PHP, CGI
–
J2EE
-
>
Java 


CMS (Content Management Systems)

–
Drupal
-
> PHP
–
SharePoint
–
Social community











different types ... explain!
\subsubsection{Non Centrally Hosted}

On the other hand, one can find between 10k to 20k instances of dedicated web servers at CERN (?) in the format of \url{http://X.cern.ch} and examples like \url{http://indico.cern.ch/}
,
–
Any technology stack (OS, web server, application platform
and frameworks etc. etc.)
–
Many visible only inside CERN
–
Others have firewall openings
–
visible from outside

[[Some numbers and figures about each category]]


\section{CERN Web Security}
current approach to ensure the security of the web applications
\subsection{Prevention}
people are encouraged to use the central services. explain why?
firewall opening procedure

\subsection{Detection}
two main areas where the vulnerabilities emerge
\subsubsection{Detection Scripts}
small scripts that are developed inside to detect vulnerable sources, most of the time when a new vuln is announced( heart bleed, shell shock, ssl3) and there is no patch yet, but some times also for mis-configuration detection (empty landing page, http authentication)
\subsubsection{Published Vulnerabilities}
vulnerabilities affecting a third part software and published in mailing lists, other sources, etc. example wordpress
usually the vulnerabilities that are from well known software, human decision if we are going to care about the vulnerability and checking if the affected software is used at CERN.

\subsection{Relevant Tools}
\subsubsection{WAS}
\subsubsection{WASDOM}
\subsubsection{List of websites and webservers}
\subsubsection{WAD and Wappalyzer}
\label{wad_section}
wana talk abut pushing upstream?
\subsubsection{SSDB?}
\subsubsection{Auto-notify?}

\section{Objectives}
improving the current approaches
\begin{itemize}
\item each script its own format. there is a need for a wrapper that has a unique format, scripts can deal with only one resource and ... [scanner-> chapter]
\item missing vulnerabilties that do not create big noises in the public, manual check for wad outputs that match. Automate the monitoring of vulnerabilities to improve speed and accuracy of responding to vulnerabilities and automate the affected resource detection. [vunerability nitification tool -> chapter]
\end{itemize}
