It is crucial for big organizations like CERN with a very large web landscape to ensure the security of their web resources. One can use various open source or commercial web scanners to scan websites and look for common, well-known web vulnerabilities. However, these scanners usually fail to find vulnerabilities that are discovered every day in software products and commonly used libraries. The main objective of this project is to automate the procedure for detecting vulnerable web applications remotely and when new vulnerabilities emerge. For this purpose, we will introduce a tool that monitors vulnerability sources to find newly discovered vulnerabilities, and detects CERN resources that use vulnerable third party products. In addition, we introduce another tool that facilitates scanning CERN resources for critical vulnerabilities in emergency cases, specially when a vulnerability is not specific to a certain, detectable third party product.
